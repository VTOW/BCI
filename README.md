# BCI

This library contains a collection of useful features to help with software development for Vex EDR robots using the RobotC language and development environment. Our team would like to thank, among many others, James Pearman for his starter ideas and concepts found throughout this project.

----------------

Currently, BCI features these tools:
 - Common math definitions and macros
 - Redefinitions of all joystick channels and buttons
 - Semaphore wrappers
 - UART wrappers
 - Filters (IIR, etc.)
 - PID control (position and velocity domain)
 - TBH control
 - Bang-bang control
 - Motor slew rate controller
 - LCD menu system
 - PID-based autonomous functions (drive in a straight line, etc.)
 - Dynamic memory (heap based)

----------------

For tutorials, see the files in the folder "Modules\Example" or the Wiki. Additionally, all header files are thoroughly and consistantly documented (these are the best sources of up-to-date information).
